# KnapsackProblemSolving

## Overview
This project contains three algorithms to solve 0-1 knapsack problems. The algorithm includes:<br>
1. Branch and Bound
2. Brute Force
3. Dynamic Programming
<p>The problem is defined as follows:</p>
<p>We are planning for a picnic. There are some items we would like to carry. Our knapsack is only able to carry 15 pounds of items. The items are given with some ratings from 1 to 10 to indicates how strongly we want to include the particular item in knapsack for the picnic. Once the item is included in the knapsack, the same item cannot be carried again.</p>

Items:
| Item          | Weight | Rating |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| Ant Repellent | 1      | 2      |
| Blanket       | 4      | 3      |
| Brownies      | 3      | 10     |
| Frisbee       | 1      | 6      |
| Salad         | 5      | 4      |
| Watermelon    | 10     | 10     |
